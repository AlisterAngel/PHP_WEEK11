# Arcade Website


## Purpose

> A PHP/mySQL website that tracks game info via CRUD, search/sort, and users via register/login.

![Image of my project](images/menu.jpg)

This website was developed in my COMP1006 Intro to Web Programming  course at Georgian College.  I was asked to create a website based on my interests, so I chose classic DOS games.  This website implements CRUD functionalities, register/login pages, securing pages via authentication, search and sort features and APIs.

## Technologies Learned
- PHP
- mySQL
- watercss
- JSON/APIs such as reCAPTCHA v.3, weather widget
- JavaScript

## Launch
- Visit [my project's website](https://lamp.computerstudi.es/~Albert2/comp1006/week11/login.php) and feel free to register/login to play around

To launch this, you'll have to clone my Github files to your PHP server, change the credentials listed in db.php, and run my .sql scripts in your mysql database.  

## Demo

Below are a series of videos, in reverse chronological order, where I'm learning about PHP/mySQL.  I attempt to explain what's happening from a coding perspective.

[Quiz 12.1](https://loom.com/insert-your-loom-url-here)
Integrated a weather widget, created my own JSON API, and included reCAPTCHA v.3

[Quiz 11.4](https://loom.com/insert-your-loom-url-here)
